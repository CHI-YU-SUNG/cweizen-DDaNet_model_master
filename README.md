# cweizen-DDaNet_model_master
  Implementation of DDaNet with backbone VGG.
  
## Statement
  * you can find the DDaNet model in **try_place/models/**
  * you can train your Dataset with DDaNet by following the **Training Steps** shown below
  * The code is trained and tested on **ASL Dataset** in numpy file
  * If there is something wrong with the code, please contact me. Thanks !
  
## Requirements
  * **Python 3.5.6**
  * pytorch 0.3.1
  * tensorflow-gpu 1.10.0
  * matplotlib 3.0.3
  * cupy 5.4.0
  
  * **GPU environment**
    * CUDA Version 8.0.61
    * CUDNN 
    * #define CUDNN_MAJOR      5
    * #define CUDNN_MINOR      1
    * #define CUDNN_PATCHLEVEL 10
    * #define CUDNN_VERSION    (CUDNN_MAJOR * 1000 + CUDNN_MINOR * 100 + CUDNN_PATCHLEVEL)
